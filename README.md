A minimal to do list app with a focus on accessibility.

Completed as a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list).

In this project I wanted to focus on making the components accessible first and foremost. I have sacrificed some additional features (due date, priority, create additional projects) in the first iteration to keep it simple and focus on accessibility.

## Accessibility concepts learned/reinforced
- Semantic HTML
- Validating HTML
- Colour contrast compliant
- Focus management
- ARIA
- Providing feedback to screenreader users via live regions
